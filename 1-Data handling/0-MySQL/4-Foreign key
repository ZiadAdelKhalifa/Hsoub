#make foreign key which is column (user_id) in table orders and it is a reference in for column ud in table users
#ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)

#according to the previous example if we delete a row in table users it will generate orphan values in table orders


#delete the foreign key in specific table
#orders_ibfk_3 :name of the foregin key in table orders
#ALTER TABLE orders DROP FOREIGN KEY orders_ibfk_3

#if a row in primary key deleted i can make the row related to it using foreign key deleted too by using cascaded in creating the foregin key
#ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

#Apply any thing happen in primary key in foreign key in case of UPDATE
#ALTER TABLE orders ADD FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
