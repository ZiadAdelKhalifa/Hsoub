#there is a problem when we use this [#select title,description from film_text where description like '%man%']
#it can bring a result as a part of a word like woman

#solve the prevoius problem using regular expretions in My SQL
#select title,description from film_text where description REGEXP '\\bman\\b'

#regexperation is very strong for example extract postal_code consits of 3 numbers
#SELECT * from address WHERE postal_code regexp '^.{3}$'


#SELECT * from film_list where title like '%bTown%' or title like '%Bird%'
#insted we use regular expretions
#SELECT * from film_list where title regexp '\\bTown\\b|\\bBird\\b' #\b means starts or ends

#SELECT * from film_list where title NOT REGEXP '\\bTown\\b|\\bBird\\b'
